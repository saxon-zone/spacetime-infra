# Fragment on Extractive Circuits, and Emerging Features of the Next Mode of Production

Gist: we're interested in the nature of modern firms and the mechanisms of ruling class reproduction under capitalism. Consider modern-day Amazon, as well as Wal-Mart from the late 2000's[^1]. In the cases of each company we think of two things: first, the dehumanizing immiseration of its labor force, and second, their highly efficient distribution networks, made possible by computerized logistics. We have another phenomenon, which I will call the extractive circuit, where money moves from the bulk of the population upwards for use by financial capital. Examples in the domestic United States include:

- The healthcare system (insurers, hospital groups, PBM's, pharmacies, etc.)
- Sports gambling
- Credit card fees, including fees and usury interest rates for card owners, but also network fees levied on businesses
- Underbanking, as in low balance fees, overdraft fees, and even the gap between interest earned by banks
- Many others: tax prep industry, inflationary fiscal policy, higher education costs, algorithmic rental pricing collusion, ...

Business will continue to tend towards highly efficient monopoly, while these extractive circuits will face increasing socioeconomic pressure to the point of crisis, and are lopped off. The resulting system will contain features of the post-capitalist mode of production.

### Exposition

Bernie-bro "1-percent-er" rhetoric is moralizing, and doesn't go far enough in its analysis. While money _is_ extracted from most people towards the richest segment of society, it immediately enters circuits of capital maintained by financial firms -- banks, hedge funds, venture capital, and the like. What happens when the tech industry can no longer create mass markets for its products? Since the pandemic, we've seen the rise and fall of web3-crypto hype, Metaverse VR hype. Regarding the present AI hype, can the tech industry create a mass market for its latest hardware, the hyperscaled data center?

Software itself is not a viable commodity in the long term for capital valorization. Open-source projects will inevitably arrive at the cheapest possible form of software distribution (i.e., just enough to cover development costs). What is left is hardware, monetized in two forms. First is hardware sales, whose profit margins can only decline[^2]. Second is the data center, which generates revenues from providing an honest service -- the storage and computation of data -- as well as economic rents, which rely on the enforcement of property rights, both physical and intellectual. This quality observed in the business model of the data center is key. We will reach a moment where the economic justifications for a privately owned data center, with its private profits, will dwindle to a negligible point; here, the vitality of such a scheme will rely solely on the reproduction of the legal system and police power, which are in present moment upheld by U.S. imperial hegemony. 

The reproduction of the U.S. ruling class partially (but not yet fully) relies on extractive circuits. If the ideological justification for the existence of billionaires is based on their prowess as innovative doers, the abatement of innovation and productive investment will draw attention to the remaining rentier extraction. (Consider the shift from older business magnates and tech founders to the contemporary front men of LLM AI: hucksters such as Altman, Pichai, and Nadella.) The redundancies of the capitalist ruling class will accumulate and reach critical mass, and the crises brought about by these extractive circuits will force the waning or dissolution of the ruling class.

Such a dissolution will produce knock-on effects on the rest of the world system. In the United States, wages will no longer be bolstered with imperial super-profits, prompting massive changes to its service-based economy, especially its excess of white-collar, professional-managerial jobs. The comprador bourgeois governments across the global south will lose the monetary, legal, and military support of their international financial partners, similarly altering the makeup of those national economies. The mechanism here needs to be described in more detail, but essentially, the end of (fully redundant) parasitic extraction from the top of society will lead to the end of auxiliary parasitisms throughout the rest of society. (Notes on the mechanism. Consider the Shinzo Abe incident, and the subsequent legislation to curtail Unification Church donations; we will see whether the UHC incident follows a similar course, ending with a legislative constriction on healthcare-based extraction. Separately, consider a sacrifice between two rentier policies, much like a fork in chess. For example, the lawsuit between OpenAI and the New York Times. If copyright law is upheld, then AI firms have no path to profitability, which may pop the tech bubble and cause disaster for markets, VC legitimacy, and so on. If instead the courts grant exceptions to copyright law for AI firms, the door opens for further carve outs, hampering U.S. financial and technological hegemony around the world. Either outcome includes long term damage to the reproduction of capitalism.)

There are two looming questions which need to be acknowledged. First is the seeming contradiction between the projections laid out here and reality: the domestic wealth gap between rich and poor is widening, and the extraction of labor from the global south is increasing[^3]. What are the observable mechanisms in which these groups will resist the widening of extractive circuits? Second, how do we account for an increasingly dire ecological disaster in our analysis? Climate-related economic pressures, such as housing insurance collapse, can be viewed as a simple accelerant to the processes described above -- a multiplier effect. Or maybe this discussion is moot: geoengineering will not do enough to stave off ecological collapse, and the Earth's judgement will be all too sudden for this society to survive it.
